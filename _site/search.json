    "text": "Data Analytics in Accounting\nData analytics is important for accounting profession because data gathering and analytics technologies have the potential to fundamentally change accounting and auditing task processes (Schneider et al.Â 2015). Scholars note that the emergence of data analytics will significantly change the infer/predict/assure (e.g., insight/foresight/oversight) tasks performed by accountants and auditors. Big data and analytics have increasingly important implications for accounting and will provide the means to improve managerial accounting, financial accounting, and financial reporting practices (Warren Jr, Moffitt, and Byrnes 2015). It is further suggested that big data offers an unprecedented potential for diverse, voluminous datasets and sophisticated analyses. Research indicates that big data has great potential to produce better forecast estimates, going concern calculations, fraud, and other variables that are of concern to both internal and external auditors (Alles 2015). Moreover, auditors might reduce audit costs and enhance profitability and effectiveness by means of big data or data analytics. Sixty-six percent of internal audit departments currently utilize some form of data analytics as part of the audit process (Protiviti 2017).\nLink of the Book Data Analytics in Accounting\n\n\nMachine Learning in Business\nThe book is under development."
